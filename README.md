Automation of home appliances like fan,light etc using IOT. Implementation of the automation done in two ways one is from website based and other is from Voice Commands to control the appliances (like Turn on light , turn off fan etc).
For this we have used Raspberry Pi3 Model B and a Relay Module and Google Tasker application.
This Project got appreciation of one of the best projects in the CSE department Project expo of our college 30 years Celebrations !
